# Street-Info-Project-Java
This program consists of 3 options: play the street game, get street info, or none. I display these options using the menu option. When the user selects "play street game" the menu option automatically runs the street game. Same applies for when the user selects "get street info". This program is a very user-friendly, fun, interactive game, and a great way to find lots of information about your specific street (Peel Region Area). Furthermore, it helps users understand the maximum speed limits for certain streets through the street game.
